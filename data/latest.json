  "briefing": "It looks like the article content didn't come through \u2014 the sections for **Global Fintech News**, **Canadian Fintech News**, and **Atlantic Canada / Ecosystem News** are all empty.\n\nCould you paste the raw articles you'd like me to work with? Once you share them, I'll organize everything into the briefing format right away. You can include:\n\n- **Article titles and URLs**\n- **Source names**\n- **Article text or summaries**\n- Or even just raw links \u2014 I'll work with whatever you have!"
